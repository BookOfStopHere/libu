[uri]:
    u_uri_t is now opaque.  Type attributes can be accessed only through their 
    getter methods, which are *new* with 2.0:
        * const char *u_uri_scheme (u_uri_t *uri)
        * const char *u_uri_user (u_uri_t *uri)
        * const char *u_uri_pwd (u_uri_t *uri)
        * const char *u_uri_host (u_uri_t *uri)
        * const char *u_uri_path (u_uri_t *uri)
        * const char *u_uri_port (u_uri_t *uri)

[buf]:
    u_buf_t is now opaque.  Type attributes can be accessed only through their
    getter methods, which where already present in 1.x:
        * void *u_buf_ptr (u_buf_t *buf);
        * size_t u_buf_len (u_buf_t *buf);
        * size_t u_buf_size (u_buf_t *buf);

[net]:
    This module has been completely revamped, both implementation and 
    interfaces have changed dramatically.  The sole chance for your application
    to be backwards compatible is in case it used the u_net_sock() interface 
    only.
    A wealth of new interfaces has been added:
