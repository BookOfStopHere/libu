LibU in a few words

    LibU is a multiplatform (UNIXes, Mac, Windows) C library which comes under 
    a BSD-style license.  It includes many interdependent modules for doing 
    different things: memory allocation, networking and URI parsing (rfc2396), 
    string manipulation, debugging and logging in a very compact way, plus many
    other miscellaneous tasks.  Its small footprint (about 70KB) and 
    multiplatform nature, makes it an ideal candidate for integration in bigger
    projects.  KLone - http://www.koanlogic.com/products/klone - is an example 
    of such a combination.

Installation

    LibU comes with MaKL (KoanLogic's autoconfiguration and building framework) 
    and should need no user's intervention for compilation and installation,
    except the classic steps:

    $ ./configure && make
    # sudo make install

    If you are installing LibU on a platform which is not yet supported by
    MaKL, the only files you need to touch are Makefile.conf and conf.h.
