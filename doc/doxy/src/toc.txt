LibU is a multiplatform C library which comes under a BSD-style license.  This 
means that you are allowed unlimited redistribution for any purpose of LibU

That said, LibU includes many interdependent modules for accomplishing several 
tasks: \ref alloc, \ref net and \ref uri parsing (as per RFC 3986), \ref string 
manipulation, \ref carpal (with bundled debugging and logging functionalities) 
of C/C++ programs in a very compact way, plus many other \ref misc tasks.  

Also, it has built-in support for tree-structured \ref config files, or flat 
configuration files which are supplied through the running process \ref env.

Hash \ref hmap's using separate (sorted) chaining or linear probing, tail 
queued \ref list, an efficient \ref rb implementation and \ref array are 
provided as building blocks for your custom data structures.

A complete machinery for handling authentication via \ref pwd like files, data 
\ref buf manipulation, a module for \ref test of C/C++ programs, and some
commodity interfaces for playing safe with the \ref fs, complete the list of
functionalities.

A portability layer is also included which gives replacement for functions 
that could be missing on some platforms, e.g. strlcat(3), strlcpy(3), 
gettimeofday(2), etc., and provide an uniform naming to absorb minor interface 
deltas between different platforms.

Check the \ref install instructions and happy hacking !
